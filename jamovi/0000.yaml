  A comprehensive range of facilities to perform umbrella reviews with
  stratification of the evidence. This module accomplishes this aim by building
  on three core functions that: (i) automatically perform all required
  calculations in an umbrella review (including but not limited to pairwise
  meta-analyses), (ii) stratify evidence according to various classification
  criteria, and (iii) generate a visual representation of the results.
