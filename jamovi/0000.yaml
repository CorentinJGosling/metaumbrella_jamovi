description: >-
  A comprehensive range of facilities to perform umbrella reviews with
  stratification of the evidence in R. The package accomplishes this aim by
  building on three core functions that: (i) automatically perform all required
  calculations in an umbrella review (including but not limited to
  meta-analyses), (ii) stratify evidence according to various classification
  criteria, and (iii) generate a visual representation of the results. Note that
  if you are not familiar with R, the core features of this package are
  available from a web browser (<https://www.metaumbrella.org/>).
