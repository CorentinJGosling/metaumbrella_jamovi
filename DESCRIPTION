Description: A comprehensive range of facilities to perform umbrella reviews with stratification of the evidence in R. The package accomplishes this aim by building on three core functions that: (i) automatically perform all required calculations in an umbrella review (including but not limited to meta-analyses), (ii) stratify evidence according to various classification criteria, and (iii) generate a visual representation of the results. Note that if you are not familiar with R, the core features of this package are available from a web browser (<https://www.metaumbrella.org/>).
